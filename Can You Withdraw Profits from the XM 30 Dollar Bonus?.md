<h2>XM Bonus Withdrawal Rules</h2>
<p>To withdraw profits earned through the XM 30 Dollar Bonus, you need to follow a set of clearly defined rules:</p>

<h3>1. Complete Account Verification</h3>
<p>Verification of your account is mandatory. This involves submitting government-issued identification and proof of residence before claiming the bonus or withdrawing profits.</p>

<h3>2. The Bonus Is Non-Withdrawable</h3>
<p>The $30 bonus is offered strictly as trading credit and cannot be withdrawn. Only profits resulting from trading activity using the bonus are eligible for withdrawal.</p>

<h3>3. Meet the Trading Volume Requirement</h3>
<p>To unlock profit withdrawal, you are required to <strong>trade at least 5 standard lots</strong> (or the equivalent in micro/mini lots) within a 30-day period after receiving the bonus.</p>

<h3>4. Withdraw Within a Limited Timeframe</h3>
<p>All trading activity and profit withdrawal must be completed within 30 days. Failing to meet the conditions may result in the expiration of the bonus and associated profits.</p>

<h3>5. One-Time Bonus Offer</h3>
<p>Each client is eligible for the XM 30 Dollar Bonus only once. This policy applies per individual, household, IP address, and device.</p>

<h2>What Happens After Meeting the Requirements?</h2>
<p>Once you've fulfilled the trading volume and verification requirements, you can submit a withdrawal request for your earned profits. XM supports multiple withdrawal methods including bank transfers and e-wallets.</p>
<p>Importantly, <strong>you are not required to make a deposit in order to withdraw profits</strong> earned from the bonus. However, making a deposit may enhance your trading options and streamline the withdrawal process.</p>
