<h2>Common XM Bonus Claim Errors and How to Fix Them</h2>

<h3>1. Registration Completed with Incorrect Information</h3>
<p>One of the most common reasons the <strong>XM 30 Dollar Bonus</strong> fails to activate is due to errors or inconsistencies in the registration details. XM has strict verification protocols, and any discrepancy between the personal information provided and the documents uploaded can result in rejection.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Double-check that your name, birth date, address, and contact details match your government-issued ID and proof of residence before submitting.</p>

<h3>2. Failure to Use a Valid Partner Code</h3>
<p>XM offers the <strong>30 Dollar Bonus</strong> only through specific partner campaigns. Users registering through the generic homepage or without a valid partner code may not be eligible.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Make sure to register through this verified bonus link and enter the partner code <strong>CTG8M</strong> during sign-up to qualify: <a href="https://affs.click/DxX1G">Register with Partner Code CTG8M for the XM 30 Dollar Bonus</a></p>

<h3>3. Required Documents Not Uploaded or Not Approved</h3>

<ul>
<li>A valid government-issued ID (e.g., passport, national ID)</li>
<li>A utility bill or bank statement as proof of residence</li>
</ul>
<p>Once approved, you can manually request the bonus.</p>

<h3>4. Bonus Request Not Submitted</h3>
<p>Even after completing registration and verification, the bonus is not automatically credited in some cases. You must actively request the <strong>XM 30 Dollar Bonus</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Go to the dashboard of your Member Area and navigate to the "Bonus" section to submit the request manually.</p>

<h3>5. Duplicate Accounts or Bonus Abuse</h3>
<p>XM has a strict one-account-per-client policy. Creating multiple accounts to claim bonuses may result in disqualification.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use your real identity and ensure you're only registering once. If your bonus was denied due to suspected duplication, contact XM support with a detailed explanation.</p>
